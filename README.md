![üòÅHaha! I don't think your connection is too weak to see this picture ü§îü§îü§î](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VThang51/Recovery-Builder-Workflows/main/images/Guide.png)
#### Manifest Type/Branch

- If your device uses Android 10+, use type "aosp". Otherwise use "omni" 

- Type and the corresponding Branch:
```bash
- omni
-- twrp-4.4-deprecated
-- ...
-- twrp-9.0
```
```bash
- aosp
-- twrp-11
-- twrp-12.1
```
#### Device Tree URL/Branch

- It's simply the URL and Branch of the Device Tree in your (or someone else's) Repository on GitHub üòã

#### Brand

- Your phone manufacturer

- Ex:
```bash
samsung
oppo
realme
```
- When filling in the Brand section, write all letters in lowercase

‚úÖÔ∏è
```bash
samsung
oppo
realme
```
‚ùåÔ∏è
```bash
Samsung
Oppo
Realme
```
#### Device Code/Makefile Type

- You can view it from the name of the .mk file

#### Add "export"

- This is used to fix build errors (You can leave it blank)

- If it fails during construction or needs an addition, follow the template below
```bash
export XXXXXX=1 && export YYYYYY=true && export ZZZZZZ=1
```
- Don't forget to add "&&"
#### Build Target

- Usually it will be "recovery", but in some cases it will be "boot"
